# Installing gmid

## dependencies

gmid depends on libtls and a C compiler.  It's reported to compile with gcc 4.2, so it should work pretty everywhere now.

The compilation is as easy as

```
make
```

Note that there isn't an install target yet.

If you're a packager, don't forget to install also the manpage gmid.1
